Automating the Silent Alarm in Banks
====================================

I first talked about this as a product [in a blog post in 2006](http://blog.wildfiction.com/2006/08/automating-silent-alarm-in-bank.html).

The Idea
========
Tellers are wired with heart-rate monitors that have wireless transmitters. If one of their heart-rates suddenly makes a significant deviance from the norm then this triggers an alarm that someone needs to investigate as this could signify a traumatic event in process such as a bank robbery.

Monetization
============
The product would be sold to banks or other institutions that may have employees at risk where a the company would benefit if management were quickly alerted if a significant "heart-rate increasing" event has taken place.
