Open-Source-Business-Ideas
==========================

A place to dump and improve on business ideas that you think are great but that you might not want to develop yourself.

Every now and then I come up with what I think is a great business idea. When I was younger I'd keep those ideas secret to myself thinking that one day I may create, develop and market that product. The cold reality is that most of these products never interested me from a business perspective and I started sharing them in the hope that someone else would take the idea and run with it and I would get the satisfaction of seeing an idea of mine taken to the open market.

The purpose of this project is to allow myself to share ideas that I've had that I hope someone will take and use to create a business for themselves. It also servers as a central location that others can:

1. Add their ideas.
1. Improve on any of the ideas.

Just fork this project, add your ideas or improvements and submit a pull request.
