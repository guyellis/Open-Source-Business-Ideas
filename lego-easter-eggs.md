# Lego Easter Eggs

Adventure instead of candy for kids at Easter.

## Idea

Take Lego kits and repackage them in plastic Easter eggs for the kids to find. (It would be awesome if the Lego company took this idea and sold this directly to the public as a seasonal item before Easter.)

Lego Company sells boxes of Legos that come with an instruction manual on how to use the pieces in the kits to make one or more toys. This idea is for an individual to repurpose the kits into a collection of easter eggs that can be hidden and found by kids at easter. Instead of eating candy at the end of the hunt they build toys.

### Product Setup / Creation

- Take a kit of (say) 110 Lego pieces
- Get 10 same-colored plastic easter eggs. If possible also get one large plastic easter egg.
- Seperate the 110 pieces into 11 piles. Put all the large pieces that won't fit in the small easter eggs in the same pile.
- Put each pile into an easter egg. Put the large pieces into a large plastic easter egg or keep aside as the bonus bundle that is given once all eggs are collected. The instruction book goes in here as well.
  - It may be necessary to put the pieces in a tiny zip lock bag inside the egg so that they are not lost when the egg is opened.
- Label the eggs with letters and numbers.
  - The letters can be anything you select or an acronym for the toy.
  - The letters are intended to group the eggs if multiple children are playing so they need to be the same for each kit.
  - The number should be ordinal representing one of a set and also indicate the total in the set. For example TC-3/9 would mean Toy Car #3 of 9.
- You should now have a collection of identically-colored Easter Eggs with the same letters and numbered 1 through N.

### Rules of Play

- As per usual the easter eggs are hidden by an adult.
- Children are told the color and letters of the eggs that they are looking for. The letters are irrelevant if there is only one color for each child.
- Instead of competitive grabbing as many eggs from each other during the hunt children are encouraged to engage in team-work by shouting out when they find an egg that's not their's to help each other find the eggs.
- Younger children should be assigned an older peer to help with numbers and letters and the older child given the team-lead title.
- Eggs should not be opened until they have all been found and brought back to HQ.
- Once all the eggs are found the kids will discover what toy they'll be building and able to build it.
