Hand Sanitization
=================

Everyone's seen those wall mounted hand sanitizers that automatically eject hand sanitizer when you hold your hands under them.

Idea
====

Companies lose billions of dollars each year to sick days. Incentivizing your employees to clean their hands regularly can dramatically reduce the spread of germs and sickness. How do we incentivize employees to regularly use these hand sanitizers?

We do this by have them scan their company badge against the dispensing device which enters their employee number/name into a lottery to win prizes each week. Maximum of one scan per hour (or ten minutes etc.) to prevent abuse.

Monetization
============

The sellers of the solutions that go into these devices would love this type of incentive and may be willing to work with a company that produces this and license this technology from them and provide prizes to companies and run this sort of thing.
