Audio Tours
===========

I remember speaking to a friend about doing this as a business in the mid-90s when the best media to do this would be cassette tapes to owners of walkman players.

The basic idea is that you record and distribute walking tours for any destination. The destination would typically be a place that was walking friendly so that someone could download and listen on their smart phone but could also be a park that you drive around.

Product Creation
================

1. You'd need to research the area that you would be creating this for.
1. A script would need to be created that would take the listener from point to point showing them the sights or features. You'd need to use permanent features that aren't likely to move to guide them.
1. You'd then need to record the audio tour and provide it through a web store/site.

Monetization
============

1. Sell the audio tour downloads through a store or iTunes or equivalent.
1. Sell in-place advertising on the recording: For example, the tour takes you past a number of restaurants or bars. The owner of an establishment would provide a coupon to anyone listening to the audio and would pay to be on there.
