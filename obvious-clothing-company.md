Obvious Clothing Company
========================

Idea
====
A clothing company that creates clothes that have words on them that states what part of the body is under that part of clothing.

A shirt may have the word shoulder on the shoulder. There are a whole ton of variations on this. You could have the different body parts in multiple languages and could also (or instead of) have the Latin/Medical term for one or more organs/bones under there. You could also attach feelings associate with those parts of the body. e.g. at the heart you could talk of love and at the stomach hunger etc.

Monetization
============

Sell the clothes.
